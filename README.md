# RT-N12E

First steps:

1. Choose router mode
2. IP mode is DHCP
3. Manually change WAN settings to Internet VID 20, set the rest to 0.

Problems:

VOIP phone won't work because the router lacks an RJ11 port.

Things I've tried to solve the problem:

* Connect RJ11 to ONT ports
* Leave the phone connected to livebox, but plug ethernet cable from livebox to asus router
* Maybe an RJ11 adapter could work?
